I wanted to add more images to my NZXT cooler screen, but CAM only allows 5 presets on the carousel function. not only that, i cant add an image with the watchface.

So this was created, a way to add various images, gifs and even videos each with custom duration, where you can select: No readings, dual Temps overlay, or watchface overlay.

use this link as a CAM webapp to see what it can do: https://charm-speckled-larkspur.glitch.me/

if you want to modify your own images, you can just do the following:

1. Download the repository
2. Save it in a folder on a safe location, like Documents, or somewhere you know you wont delete it.
3. Double click index.html so that it opens in your browser
4. Copy the local file url from your browser
5. Use that local file url as your NZXT CAM web integration link.
6. To modify images, just edit the mediaFiles array in script.js, modify its properties to fit your image.
