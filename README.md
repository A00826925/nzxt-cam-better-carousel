I wanted to add more images to my NZXT cooler screen, but CAM only allows 5 faces on the carousel function. not only that, i cant add an image with the watchface.

So this was created, a way to add various images, gif and even videos each with custom duration, were you can select either No readings, dual Temps overlay, or watchface overlay.

use this link as a CAM webapp to see what it can do: https://charm-speckled-larkspur.glitch.me/

if you dont want to self host this, you can modify a couple lines on index.html and on the script media sources to make it work on glitch.com
